# Adversarial Robustness Certification for Bayesian Neural Networks

Code repository for the journal paper of the same name. This repository contains all of the code and scripts to reproduce the experiments in the paper. This includes: 

* Training of BNNs with a variety of inference methods
* Certification of probabilistic robustness for BNNs
* Certification of decision robustness for BNNs
* Certification for each property in classification and regression settings
* Certification of uncertainty

In addition, this repository contains experiments across all the datasets in the paper (ACAS, UCI, MNIST, GTSRB).
